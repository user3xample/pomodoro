# What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

## How it Works:
+ Start our timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer is up.
+ We will mark off one pomodoro.
+ Then enjoy a five-minute break.
+ After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 30 minute break.

The 25-minute work sprints are the core of the method, but a Pomodoro practice also includes three rules for getting the most out of each interval:

1.  Break down complex projects. If a task requires more than four pomodoros, it needs to be divided into smaller, actionable steps. Sticking to this rule will help ensure you make clear progress on your projects.

2.  Small tasks go together. Any tasks that will take less than one Pomodoro should be combined with other simple tasks. For example, "write rent check," "set vet appointment," and "read Pomodoro article" could go together in one session.

3.  Once a pomodoro is set, it must ring. The pomodoro is an indivisible unit of time and can not be broken, especially not to check incoming emails, team chats, or text messages. Any ideas, tasks, or requests that come up should be taken note of to come back to later. A digital task manager like Todoist is a great place for these, but pen and paper will do too.

Please note:
In the event of an unavoidable disruption, take your five-minute break and start again. Cirillo recommends that you track interruptions (internal or external) as they occur and reflect on how to avoid them in your next session.

The rule applies even if you do finish your given task before the timer goes off.

# dependencies:
#### math, tkinter, gtts , pygames, io.
tthe main script needs to be in a folder with tomato.png
also requires for the speach, internet connection for gtts as its google translate i'm using.

If you dont want speach just comment out all the Say cmds.  if you want to removee the speach so you dont need the google translate remove gtts , pygames and io modules. and the speach mechnism section along with the say cmds. it should work with out that.
Oh and also feel free to stick any other witty comments in the say cmds also.

Enjoy and thanks for taking the time to look at this little project.
